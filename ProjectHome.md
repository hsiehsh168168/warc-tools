All development has ceased on this version of warctools.

A newer version in python has been published and is maintained on our site here: http://code.hanzoarchives.com/warc-tools


The main goal of WARC Tools is to facilitate and promote the adoption of the [WARC file format](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000236.shtml) for storing web archives by the mainstream web development community by providing an open source software library, a set of command line tools, web server plug-ins and technical documentation for manipulation and management of web archive files, or WARC files.

WARC files are produced by web archiving crawlers, such as [Heritrix](http://crawler.archive.org), the open-source, extensible, Web-scale, archiving quality Web crawler developed by the Internet Archive with the Nordic National Libraries, and Hanzo's own commercial crawlers.

The project is lead by [Hanzo Archives](http://www.hanzoarchives.com/), in collaboration with [Internet Archive Web team](http://www.archive.org/web/web.php), and supported by the [International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)](http://netpreserve.org/).
